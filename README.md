# BrowserSensor
The sensor is a Google Chrome extension that captures the open tabs in the browser and measures how long they have been open and in use. The goal is to track the usage time of productive web pages, awarding points based on a set usage duration. These points are then sent and stored in the user's profile available in the bGames cloud module.

## Prequisites

    Version `128.0.6613.120` or higher
